// Any function def by function key word is moved to the top when js starts executing code
// this means the function with the function keyword can be written after calling it and it will work fine
//visevarsa for the const keyword
//var key word is also hoisted but it is not for a function
//if you def a variable using var js hoists it to top and assigns undefined to it 
//so

console.log(a)
var a=2

//returns undefined
//var is not a good way of def variables
